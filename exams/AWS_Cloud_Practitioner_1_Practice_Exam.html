Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase a Reserved Instance for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances cannot be interrupted. So this is the correct option.</p>\n\n<p>EC2 Pricing Options Overview:\n<img src=\"https://media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt2-q8-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>On-Demand Instance</strong> - An On-Demand Instance is an instance that you use on-demand. You have full control over its lifecycle \u2014 you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running. The price per second for a running On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. However, On-demand instances are not as cost-effective as Reserved instances, so this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spot Instance</strong> - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time. So this option is not correct for the given use-case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dedicated Host</strong> - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. They're not cost-efficient compared to On-Demand instances. So this option is not correct.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/</a></p>\n",

In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deploy the database via Elastic Beanstalk</strong> - You cannot deploy only a database via Elastic Beanstalk as its meant for automatic application deployment when you upload your code. Then Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. Hence this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Configure the database in RDS read replica mode with automatic failover to the standby</strong> - For RDS, Read replicas allow you to create read-only copies that are synchronized with your master database. There is no standby available while using read replicas. In case of infrastructure failure, you have to manually promote the read replica to be its own standalone DB Instance, which means that the database endpoint would change. Therefore, this option is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deploy the database via CloudFormation</strong> - You can deploy the database via CloudFront for sure, however, it does not provide any automatic recovery in case of a disaster.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/</a></p>\n",

You can use access keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK). Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID and a secret access key. As a user name and password, you must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests.\nWhen you create an access key pair, save the access key ID and secret access key in a secure location. The secret access key is available only at the time you create it. If you lose your secret access key, you must delete the access key and create a new one.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Create a new IAM user and share the username and password</strong> - This is not a viable option, IAM user credentials are not needed to access resources programmatically.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Multi Factor Authentication to access AWS resources programmatically</strong> - For increased security, AWS recommends that you configure multi-factor authentication (MFA) to help protect your AWS resources. You can enable MFA for IAM users or the AWS account root user. MFA adds extra security because it requires users to provide unique authentication from an AWS supported MFA mechanism in addition to their regular sign-in credentials when they access AWS websites or services. MFA cannot be used for programmatic access to AWS resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use IAM Groups to access AWS resources programmatically</strong> - An IAM Group is a collection of IAM users.

This shared model can help relieve the customer\u2019s operational burden as AWS operates, manages and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the service operates.</p>\n\n<p>Controls that apply to both the infrastructure layer and customer layers, but in completely separate contexts or perspectives are called shared controls. In a shared control, AWS provides the requirements for the infrastructure and the customer must provide their own control implementation within their use of AWS services.

You also can require strong password practices, such as complexity level, avoiding re-use, and enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA).
