It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives the highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources. <strong>Examples - Amazon EC2 (on AWS), GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode.</strong></p>\n\n<p>PaaS removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. You don\u2019t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. <strong>Examples - Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS), Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft).</strong></p>\n\n<p>SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. With a SaaS offering, you don\u2019t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software. <strong>Examples - Amazon Rekognition, Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Overview of Cloud Computing Types:\n<img src=\"https://media.datacumulus.com/aws-clf-pt/assets/pt1-q1-i1.jpg\">\nvia - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/</a></p>\n\n<p>You can use Amazon Rekognition to add image and video analysis to your applications using proven, highly scalable, deep learning technology that requires no machine learning expertise. With Amazon Rekognition, you can identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities in images and videos as well as detect any inappropriate content. Rekognition is an example of Software as a Service model.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon EC2</strong> - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Hence, it comes under Infrastructure as a Service type of Cloud Computing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</strong> - AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. You simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. Per the definitions above, Elastic Beanstalk falls under the Platform as a Service type.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Elastic Load Balancing</strong> - Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. This has been added as a distractor.</p>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/\">https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/\">https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/</a></p>\n", "answers": ["<p>Amazon EC2</p>", "<p>Amazon Rekognition</p>", "<p>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</p>", "<p>Elastic Load Balancing</p>"] }, "correct_response": ["b"], "section": "Cloud Concepts", "question_plain": "Which of the following AWS services comes under the Software as a Service (SaaS) Cloud Computing Type?", "related_lectures": [] }, { "_class": "assessment", "id": 19322783, "assessment_type": "multiple-choice", "prompt": { "question": "<p>Which of the following AWS services is essential for implementing security of resources in AWS Cloud?</p>\n", "relatedLectureIds": "", "feedbacks": ["", "", "", ""], "explanation": "<p>Correct option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</strong></p>\n\n<p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. IAM enables security best practices by allowing you to grant unique security credentials to users and groups to specify which AWS service APIs and resources they can access. These features make IAM an important service for the overall security of AWS resources in your account. IAM is secure by default; users have no access to AWS resources until permissions are explicitly granted.</p>\n\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Amazon CloudWatch</strong> - Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and IT managers. CloudWatch provides data and actionable insights to monitor applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. This is an excellent service for building Resilient systems. Think resource performance monitoring, events, and alerts; think CloudWatch.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS Shield</strong> - AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection. AWS Shield cannot be used to handle resource-specific security on AWS.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWS WAF</strong> - By using AWS WAF, you can configure web access control lists (Web ACLs) on your CloudFront distributions or Application Load Balancers to filter and block requests based on request signatures. Besides, by using AWS WAF's rate-based rules, you can automatically block the IP addresses of bad actors when requests matching a rule exceed a threshold that you define. AWS WAF cannot be used to handle resource-specific security on AWS.</p>\n\n<p>Reference:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">https://aws.amazon.com/iam/</a></p>\n", "answers": ["<p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</p>", "<p>Amazon CloudWatch</p>", "<p>AWS Shield</p>", "<p>AWS WAF</p>"] }, "correct_response": ["a"], "section": "Cloud Concepts", "question_plain": "Which of the following AWS services is essential for implementing security of resources in AWS Cloud?", "related_lectures": [] }, { "_class": "assessment", "id": 19322805, "assessment_type": "multiple-choice", "prompt": { "question": "<p>Which tool will help you review your workloads against current AWS best practices for cost optimization, security, and performance improvement and then obtain advice to architect them better?</p>\n", "relatedLectureIds": "", "feedbacks": ["", "", "", ""], "explanation": "<p>Correct option:\n<strong>AWS Trusted Advisor</strong></p>\n\n<p>AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides you real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices on cost optimization, security, fault tolerance, service limits, and performance improvement. Whether establishing new workflows, developing applications, or as part of ongoing improvement, recommendations provided by Trusted Advisor regularly help keep your solutions provisioned optimally.
